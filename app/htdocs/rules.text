No multi-accounting. No meta-gaming. Do not work around the game messaging/press rules. Do not use the software or moderators as a diplomacy tactic. The pause/unpause feature is not a diplomatic tool. Do not access another player's account with their permission. Do not spam the forum or private messaging system. 

**In short, follow common sense.**
